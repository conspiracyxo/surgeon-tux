I think my favorite line is "and I pay my momma bills." That line is dope! Bodak Yellow hit number one on the Billboard Top 100 in August of this year. This makes Cardi B the first female artist to get a number one spot as a solo hit, no guest appearances at all. 

You can check out her website at http://iamcardib.com/.
