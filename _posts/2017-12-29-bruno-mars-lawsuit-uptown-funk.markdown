So it looks like another star is having legal problems. Bruno Mars, the new R&B legend has suffered some legal problems due to the production on his last album - [24k Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24K_Magic_(album)). Now, I personally think this was a bomb ass album. It has a retro feel to it, and blends the old-school funk and soul in a lovely way. In fact, I think more artists should try to make albums like this that sound different from what the rest of the industry is doing. But that's just me! 

Some musicians out there are not totally happy with the sounds heard on this joint. For one, the ladies from *The Sequence* are claiming that the song _Uptown Funk_ sounds a little bit too much like their hit _Funk You Up_. I'm going to put the video in here just so you can see if there is a difference yourself. Curiously, as I searched for "Funk You Up' on YouTube, Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson are the top hit with "Uptown Funk." Now, I guess that would make me a little mad too! Go ahead and listen to the song...

Personally, I dont hear much of a resemblance between the two songs. The beat seems different, and the song by The Sequence is a rap song, not melodic R&B tune. Actually, I'm not a fan of the song "Funk You Up." I appreciate old school rap, but this is not one of my favorites. However, the song did become the first rap song to hit the Billboard Top 50, so I give it the respect it deserves. 

The 70's group is alleging that Uptown Funk contains "significant and substantially similar compositional elements." I disagree. Uptown Funk sounds familiar to me, but that is because it combines a lot of the elements popular in the 70's and 80's. I can't fathom how anyone could think Bruno's hit (with Mark Ronson) has "significant" or substantial similarity with "Funk You Up." What are these people smoking? 

Of course the gals from The Sequence are asking for money to settle before trial. We don't know how much they want, but I'm sure it's a pretty penny. Sounds like a money grab to me. People are showing up from the 70's and 80's looking for an easy payday from Bruno's music. They should be glad that he is paying tribute to that era by keeping the music alive with today's generation. 

However, this is not the first time Bruno has been targeted. [Zapp and Roger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapp_(band)), one of my all-time favorites, asserted a claim against Uptown Funk earlier this year. They stated that the first 50 seconds or so of the song sounded just like "More Bounce to the Ounce." Now aside from the singing, this one makes a little more sense. There is a similar beat and the guitar riff is very similar. However, the songs are not so much alike that there is danger of confusing them. You can easily tell one from another during this intro.

I think everyone needs to stop trippin' over good music. All these songs have their place in history. As an avid user, I can easily tell one from another. I don't think Bruno intentionally stole parts of the songs to make his music. Rather, I think he just thought of things he liked when he was younger and tried to bring them altogether. The older artists should just let things be. [Celebrity lawsuits](http://skullnbones.website/beyonce/2017/12/29/Beyonces-trademark-problems-blue-ivy.html) need to be saved for true instances of stolen music.
