(New York, NY) In an attempt to keep her lawsuit details private, singer and diva [Beyonce Knowles](https://www.beyonce.com/) lost a court proceeding that would have allowed her to do just that. Her trademark woes began earlier this year when she tried to trademark the name "Blue Ivy." This is also the name of her young child with rap mogul Jay-Z. The queen of divas intended to use the brand for make-up, fashion and boutique electronics. Obtaining the rights to the name would allow her to have exclusive use of the brand, and she could presumably use her star power to make the brand a household name. 

Too bad for Beyonce. She hit a serious roadblock earlier this year when an ordinary civilian named Veronica Morales claimed that she was already using a version of the name. Morales owns an even planning agency called [Blue Ivy Company](http://www.blueivyevents.com/). This firm has been around for years using the name, and its website (blueivyevents.com) is filled with event pics from the past years. Ms. Morales says the business was started a few years before young Blue Ivy was even born. Morales' intent in using the name is clear from the website. It also has a beautiful background of blue ivy growing on a building. What else would you expect with the name? 

After learning of Beyonce's intent, the agency owner served legal papers on the singer. In short, Blue Ivy Events' lawyers requested to have a deposition with Beyonce. The *Queen Bee* got her legal team together and filed a motion to keep the proceeding secret, presumably due to her celebrity status. 

The matter was heard by the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal board. The administrative court examined Beyonce's claim that her family's safety was in danger if the proceeding was unveiled to the public. Beyonce's legal team also argued that that public information as to the singer's whereabouts tended to draw large crowds and required high levels of security. *Clearly*, the baard disagreed with Queen Bee. The motion was denied and Beyonce is now subject to attend the deposition without any real privacy. 

It should be noted that the public will not be allowed into the deposition itself. Rather, Beyonce's legal team was concerned about fans gathering in the area and possibly intruding in the star's life while she tries to handle serious legal business. In my opinion, it is a valid concern on her part. Who wants to have a bunch of lookey-loos hanging around when you are trying work on something serious. 

The funny thing about this is that it is not the first time these two parties have butted heads. Blue Ivy Events had to fight Beyonce back in 2012 when the diva first tried to trademark the name. I guess she was unaware of the fact that Morales had already secured a trademark for it. It seems ridiculous that Beyonce would try to slide this through again when Morales is obviously paying attention to grabs for the name. Then again, there are those that will say there is enough room for two Blue Ivy companies in the world. No one is likely to confuse the two since they are engaged in totally separate businesses. I could see that Morales would have a point if Beyonce wanted to open an event planning firm. But she is headed in a totally different direction with this company. We even found another company using the name for a [Blue Ivy Bakery](https://www.blueivycompany.com/). I wonder if Morales went after this business too? Who knows. Maybe they only want to sue someone with deep pockets. Just my opinion!
