Lil Wayne cancelled his appearance at a recent concert in Columbia, S.C. when security wanted to do their usual checks on him. According to the spokesperson for the venue, The Colonial Life Arena,  the 34-year old rapper would not enter the building when it appeared that security was going to check him. Colonial Life Arena would not let him in without having their big, burly security guards grope the hip hop star. 

The arena stated that "the safety of its patrons, its performers, and its staff members is and continues to be the number one priority." However, it is unclear how Lil Wayne poised a threat anyone in the arena. Presumably he got paid to show up and do a show. It is unlikley that he would pull out a gun an start shooting his own fans and arena patrons. Wayne is also just coming off hospitalization for seizures that caused him to cancel his last event. So far, Wayne's camp has not commented on the situation. 

Concert goers may be disappointed at the conflict but refunds are on the way beginning on Monday, October 2nd. But really, how can you be mad at Wayne for this? What venue or promoter is going to waste time checking headliners for security violations? It seems a little over zealous on part of the arena. I mean, I could see if they were tipped off that Wayne and crew were toting guns around and threatening to use them. However, in absence of this I really don't see why the security checks are needed on performers. The performers are the ones that have the most to lose if something goes down. It's unlikely that they are going to start a gang war at a huge arena like Colonial Life. If anyone is at fault for ruining the show, it is the arena. I guess that's why they are now giving refunds!
