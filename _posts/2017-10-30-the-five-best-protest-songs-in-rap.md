Hip Hop music was born out of rebellion. In the early eighties the new sound rebelled against the disco and funk sounds of the 70's. The new form of urban music also attacked social inequalities and political bias; in a sense it was a musical extension of the Civil Rights Movement. Groups such as Public Enemy, N.W.A. and Gang Starr talked about the tough streets and poverty experience like we had never heard before. Therefore, it goes without saying that Hip Hop is home to many "protest" style anthems that are still blasted by today's anti-establishment protesters. Here is a look at five of the best protest songs in the world of rap and Hip Hop. 

## 1. "Fuck tha Police" - N.W.A. 
Listing this song is mandatory. This is perhaps one of the most notoriest protest songs of all time. During its time it was uber controversial and divisive. Some understood the rage and vengefulness fueled by the song. Others thought it was an outright disgrace to outlandishly disrespect law enforcement. Either way, this is a song that has just as much relevance today as it did back in the late 80's and early 90's.

## 2. "Fight the Power" - Public Enemy
No list of protest songs would be complete without Public Enemy. This song not only embodies the protest spirit, it actually clearly states its purpose. The song first became famous from Spike Lee's classic 1989 film ["Do the Right Thing."](http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620) Since then it is the fall back song for getting a protest started. With lyrics like "gotta give us what we want, gotta give us what we need," you know the mood is going to be set.

## 3. "Police State" - Dead Prez
This is a hard hitting song that mainly discusses the prison industrial complex. The chorus echoes... "to have a black male live a third of his life in a jail cell, cuz the world is controlled by the white male." The song has a strong revolutionary undertone with statements like "the people never get justice... and the jobs never pay enough," this song is sure to change the way you look at modern society. The amazing thing is that the song was made back in 2000, way before Wikileaks, before today's conspiracy movement and before the shootings of the likes of Freddie Grey and others. The song is a cold statement about life in new century and an eerie premonition of things to come. It definitely deserves a listen, or several.
