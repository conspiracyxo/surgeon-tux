Hip Hop music was born out of rebellion. In the early eighties the new sound rebelled against the disco and funk sounds of the 70's. The new form of urban music also attacked social inequalities and political bias; in a sense it was a musical extension of the Civil Rights Movement. Groups such as Public Enemy, N.W.A. and Gang Starr talked about the tough streets and poverty experience like we had never heard before. Therefore, it goes without saying that Hip Hop is home to many "protest" style anthems that are still blasted by today's anti-establishment protesters. Here is a look at five of the best protest songs in the world of rap and Hip Hop. 

## 1. "Fuck tha Police" - N.W.A. 
Listing this song is mandatory. This is perhaps one of the most notoriest protest songs of all time. During its time it was uber controversial and divisive. Some understood the rage and vengefulness fueled by the song. Others thought it was an outright disgrace to outlandishly disrespect law enforcement. Either way, this is a song that has just as much relevance today as it did back in the late 80's and early 90's.

## 2. "Fight the Power" - Public Enemy
No list of protest songs would be complete without Public Enemy. This song not only embodies the protest spirit, it actually clearly states its purpose. The song first became famous from Spike Lee's classic 1989 film ["Do the Right Thing."](http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620) Since then it is the fall back song for getting a protest started. With lyrics like "gotta give us what we want, gotta give us what we need," you know the mood is going to be set.

## 3. "Police State" - Dead Prez
This is a hard hitting song that mainly discusses the prison industrial complex. The chorus echoes... "to have a black male live a third of his life in a jail cell, cuz the world is controlled by the white male." The song has a strong revolutionary undertone with statements like "the people never get justice... and the jobs never pay enough," this song is sure to change the way you look at modern society. The amazing thing is that the song was made back in 2000, way before Wikileaks, before today's conspiracy movement and before the shootings of the likes of Freddie Grey and others. The song is a cold statement about life in new century and an eerie premonition of things to come. It definitely deserves a listen, or several.

## 4. "Mathematics" - Mos Def 
This is one of my favorite all time songs by social activist and rapper Yasiin Bey. This song is intellegent as it is creative. It's use of numbers to address social ills is on its own level. One bar states "young bloods can't spell but they can rock you at Playstation." This song is full of statisics that will back up every claim made by Bey. As he states..."numbers are hard to feel and they never have feelings." In this sense, numbers give the listener a palpable understanding of how social oppression affects them.

## 5. "Bin Ladin"- Immortal Technique 
This song addresses the 9/11 controversy. Immortal Technique goes hard on the Bush admnistration by saying "Bin Ladin didn't blow up the projects... Bush knocked down the towers." Over the catchy beat I.T. discusses the occupation in the Middle East and presents the other side of the conflict. He also speaks on the military industrial complex and subjects of American notoriety such as the D.C. sniper. The lyrics on this song are practically unmatched. Check out the part that says...
-"I don't rap for dead presidents
-I'd rather see the presiden dead
-It's never been said, 
-but I set precedents! -- Immortal Techinique in Bin Ladin. 
These are some gutsy lyrics but they also show off I.T's almost extraterrestial rhyming abilities. It's a good jam to listen too even if you are not into the 9/11 conspiracy stuff. Eminem and Mos Def even make an appearance on this track.
